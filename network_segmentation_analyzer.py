[WARNING] Network segmentation issues detected

The analysis indicates that the current network segmentation does not follow best practices 
for OT security. There appear to be direct connections between zones that should be isolated 
from each other according to the Purdue Model for industrial control systems.

Recommendations:
1. Implement proper network segmentation following the Purdue Model:
   - Level 0/1: Field devices and control systems
   - Level 2: Supervisory control
   - Level 3: Site operations management
   - Levels 4/5: IT business systems
   
2. Use firewalls between all zones with strict access control lists
   - Only allow necessary communication between adjacent levels
   - Log all cross-zone traffic for security monitoring
   
3. Implement a properly configured DMZ between IT and OT networks
   - Use data diodes or unidirectional gateways where appropriate
   - Deploy security monitoring at zone boundaries
   
4. Consider "defense in depth" with multiple security controls at each boundary

5. Develop and implement a formal network segmentation policy
